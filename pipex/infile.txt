In the year 2147, humanity discovered a parallel universe accessible through a mysterious
portal. Earth's doppelganger, Utopia, thrived with advanced technology and unity.
A scientist, Dr. Evelyn Grant, embarked on a mission to exchange knowledge.
However, upon arrival, she uncovered a dark secret:
Utopians sustained their society by draining energy from alternate Earths.
Shocked, Evelyn raced against time to close the portal, preventing Earth's demise.
Sacrificing her return, she sealed the gateway, leaving Utopia in eternal darkness.
Back on Earth, Evelyn's revelation spurred a collective effort to protect their world
and seek progress without harming others.
